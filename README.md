# ssd-status

SSD Status is a simple utility that I wrote to monitor the usage of the SSD drive in my computer (and play around with ReactiveExtensions).

## Features

1. Read Crucial SSD drives SMART usage attributes
1. Draw charts of the Host Writes attribute in real time
1. Draw charts of historical usage for the following attributes:
    - Host Writes
    - Power on Hours
    - Wear Levelling
    - Percent Life
    - Power Cycle Count
1. Export the monitored attribute readings to a CSV file
